# Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating a simple neural network that classifies handwritten digits.
It is based on the practice labs from a machine learning course, and some utility modules referenced in the notebook are not included here.

A `requirements.txt` file is provided for convenience.

# Digits_recognizer_Neuralnetwork
Recognize hand written digits classifier from 0 to 9.

# Requirements
- Python 3
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tensorflow

# Used Package
Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow(Keras/Sequential Model and Dense Layer)

# Approach
Binary Classification 
--> Use ReLU, Softmax Function.

# Progress
Variable check & Visualize
--> Model Representation
--> Model Implementation
--> Softmax Placement

Epoch: 100 times

## Usage

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter and open `Digits_recognizer.ipynb` to run the notebook.

The dataset and helper functions (`autils`, `public_tests`, `lab_utils_softmax`, etc.) used in the original course material are not part of this repository.
You may need to modify the notebook to load your own data or provide alternative implementations for these helpers.
